GIT BASICS – ADVANCED & PRACTICAL NOTES

These notes explain WHAT, WHY, and WHEN to use each Git command,
with real-world and interview-level understanding.

CONFIGURING GIT (ONE-TIME SETUP)

Git needs your identity to attach author information to commits.

Commands:
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com
"
git config --list

Important:

--global applies to all repositories

Without this, Git will not allow commits

REPOSITORY LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW

Working Directory -> Staging Area -> Local Repository -> Remote Repository

Working Directory : Where you edit files
Staging Area : Files ready to be committed
Local Repository : Commits stored locally
Remote Repository : GitHub / GitLab

CLONE & STATUS

CLONE (Remote -> Local)
Creates a local copy of a remote repository.

Command:
git clone <repository-link>

After cloning:

.git folder is created (Git database)

origin remote is automatically set

STATUS (Most Used Command)
Shows the current state of the repository.

Command:
git status

File States:

Untracked : New files Git is not tracking

Modified : Tracked files with changes

Staged : Changes ready to commit

Unmodified: No changes

NAVIGATION & FILE LISTING

Change Directory:
cd <folder-name>

List Files:
ls -> visible files
ls -a -> visible + hidden files (.git, .env)

ADD & COMMIT (CORE CONCEPT)

ADD (Working Directory -> Staging Area)

git add <file-name>
git add .

Why staging exists:

Allows partial commits

Gives control over commits

COMMIT (Snapshot, NOT file upload)

git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"

Good commit message:

Short and clear

Present tense
Example: Add login validation

PUSH (LOCAL -> REMOTE)

Uploads commits to GitHub.

git push origin main

origin -> remote name
main -> branch name

INIT (CREATE REPOSITORY FROM SCRATCH)

Used when project already exists locally.

git init
git remote add origin <repository-link>
git remote -v
git branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Why -u matters:
After this, you can use:
git push
git pull

BRANCHING (PROFESSIONAL WORKFLOW)

Why branches exist:

Isolate features

Protect production code

Team collaboration

Commands:
git branch -> list branches
git checkout <branch-name> -> switch branch
git checkout -b <new-branch> -> create & switch
git branch -d <branch-name> -> delete branch

Rule:
Never work directly on main in real projects.

MERGING CODE

Way 1: Command Line Merge

git diff <branch-name> -> preview changes
git merge <branch-name> -> merge branches

Way 2: Pull Request (Industry Standard)

Push feature branch

Create PR on GitHub

Review code

Merge into main

PULL REQUEST (PR)

A Pull Request is a request to merge code into another branch.

Benefits:

Code review

Team discussion

CI/CD checks

PULL (REMOTE -> LOCAL)

git pull origin main

Internally:
git fetch + git merge

MERGE CONFLICTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Occurs when:

Same file

Same lines

Different changes

Steps to resolve:

Open conflicted file

Fix code manually

Remove conflict markers

git add + git commit

UNDOING CHANGES (SAFELY)

Undo staged changes:
git reset <file-name>
git reset

Undo last commit (keep code):
git reset HEAD~1

Undo commits completely (dangerous):
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

Warning:
Never use --hard on shared branches.

FORK (OPEN SOURCE WORKFLOW)

A fork is your personal copy of another repository.

Workflow:

Fork repository

Clone fork

Create branch

Push changes

Create PR to original repo

MENTAL MODEL (MUST REMEMBER)

Git tracks files, not folders

Commits are snapshots, not differences

Branch is just a pointer to a commit

==================================================
GIT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

Q1. What is Git?
A distributed version control system for tracking source code changes.

Q2. Git vs GitHub?
Git : Version control tool
GitHub : Hosting platform

Q3. What is a commit?
A snapshot of the project at a point in time.

Q4. What is staging area?
Area where changes are prepared before commit.

Q5. What is a branch?
A pointer to a commit allowing parallel development.

Q6. git pull vs git fetch?
fetch : downloads changes
pull : fetch + merge

Q7. What is a merge conflict?
When Git cannot auto-merge changes.

Q8. What is a Pull Request?
Request to merge code after review.

Q9. What does git reset do?
Moves HEAD to a previous commit.

Q10. What is a fork?
A personal copy of another repository.

==================================================
REAL TEAM WORKFLOW (FEATURE -> PR -> MERGE)

Update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/login-validation

Work & commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add login validation"

Push branch
git push origin feature/login-validation

Create PR on GitHub
Base : main
Compare : feature/login-validation

Code review & fixes

Merge PR and delete branch

==================================================
GITHUB + VS CODE WORKFLOW

Clone repo:
git clone <repo-link>

VS Code:

Source Control tab

Stage changes (+)

Add commit message

Commit

Push / Pull:

Sync Changes

Pull button

Merge conflicts:

Accept Current

Accept Incoming

Accept Both

==================================================
1-PAGE ADVANCED GIT CHEAT SHEET

Daily:
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
git pull

Branching:
git checkout -b feature-name
git branch -d feature-name

Undo:
git reset <file>
git reset HEAD~1
git reset --hard <hash>

Inspect:
git log
git diff
git branch
git remote -v

Safety Rules:

Never force push to main

Avoid --hard on shared branches

Always pull before pushing
